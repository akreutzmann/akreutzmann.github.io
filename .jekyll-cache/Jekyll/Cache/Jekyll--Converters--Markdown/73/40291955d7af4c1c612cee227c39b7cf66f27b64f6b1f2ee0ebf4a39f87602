<p>The R package <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/emdi/index.html"><strong>emdi</strong></a> provides a large collection of small area estimation methods. The package documentation and the vignettes serve the purpose to explain the available methods and/or to shows the functionality. This page will offer small examples for specific applications.</p>

<p>For the most recent technical and methodological updates, <strong>emdi</strong> is available on <a href="https://github.com/SoerenPannier/emdi">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h3 id="overview-of-the-content-in-emdi">Overview of the content in <strong>emdi</strong></h3>

<p>The methods implemented in <strong>emdi</strong> can be classified into following categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Direct estimation</li>
  <li>Area-level models</li>
  <li>Unit-level models</li>
</ul>

<p>While direct estimation is provided, the focus of the package are the small area estimation methods. Therefore, the following descriptions will focus on the small area estimation methods.</p>

<h4 id="area-level-models">Area-level models</h4>

<p>With function Â´fhÂ´, package <strong>emdi</strong> provides a large range of area-level models basically following the idea of Fay and Herriot (1979). The function includes following modelling options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Basic area-level model</li>
  <li>Usage of transformations: log and arcsin</li>
  <li>Spatial correlation</li>
  <li>Measurement errors</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="unit-level-models">Unit-level models</h4>

<p>Most unit-level models are based on the model proposed by Battesse, Harter and Fuller (1988). The model implemented in the package <strong>emdi</strong> is the empirical best prediction approach following Molina and Rao (2010). Additional features comprise the usage of transformations (Rojas-Perilla et al. 2020) and the inclusion of sampling weights (Guadarrama et al. 2018).</p>
