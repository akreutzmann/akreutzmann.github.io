%### Basic area-level model</p>

<p>%The basic area-level model was proposed by <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2286322?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents">Fay and Herriot (1979)</a>. It requires a direct estimator which %could be a total or a mean and its corresponding variance as well as covariate information on the domain level. While the direct estimator bears uncertainty, the covariate %information is assumed to be without measurement error. Therefore, registers and administrative data are often used as covariate information. The function provides various %estimation approaches for the variance of the random effects and the mean squared error. The following code example will show how to estimate basic area-level estimators and which %functions are available for this model class.</p>
