title: emdi - The R package for estimating and mapping disaggregated indicators
---

The R package [**emdi**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/emdi/index.html) provides a large collection of small area estimation methods. The package documentation and the vignettes serve the purpose to explain the available methods and/or to shows the functionality. This page will offer small examples for specific applications. 

For the most recent technical and methodological updates, **emdi** is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/SoerenPannier/emdi).

### Overview 

The methods implemented in **emdi** can be classified into following categories: 
- Direct estimation 
- Area-level models 
- Unit-level models 

While direct estimation is provided, the focus of the package are the small area estimation methods. Therefore, the following descriptions will focus on the small area estimation methods. 

#### Area-level models 

With function `fh`, package **emdi** provides a large range of area-level models basically following the idea of [Fay and Herriot (1979)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2286322?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents). The function includes following modelling options: 

* Basic area-level model
* Transformations: log and arcsin 
* Spatial correlation 
* Robust estimation
* Measurement errors

#### Unit-level models 

Most unit-level models are based on the model proposed by [Battese, Harter and Fuller (1988)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2288915?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents). So far, the package provides some variations of the empirical best prediction (EBP) approach proposed by [Molina and Rao (2010)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27896031?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents):

* Census EBP approach (mentioned in [Guadarrama et al. 2016](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304826774_A_comparison_of_small_area_estimation_methods_for_poverty_mapping))
* Data-driven transformations for the EBP ([Rojas et al. 2020](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/rssa.12488))
* EBP under informative sampling ([Guadarrama et al. 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167947317302517))
